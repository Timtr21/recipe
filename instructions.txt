Vietnamese fresh roll
Ingredients
(Serves 4; makes about 8 rolls)

For the Rolls:
8 rice paper wrappers
1 cup cooked vermicelli noodles
16 medium shrimp, cooked, peeled, and halved lengthwise
(or substitute with tofu, shredded chicken, or your choice of protein)
1 cup lettuce leaves, torn into small pieces
1 cup bean sprouts
1 small carrot, julienned
1 small cucumber, julienned
Fresh herbs: mint leaves, cilantro, and Thai basil
For the Peanut Dipping Sauce:
1/4 cup hoisin sauce
2 tbsp peanut butter
2 tbsp water
1 tsp soy sauce
1 clove garlic, minced
Crushed peanuts (for garnish)
(Optional: add a splash of sriracha for spice)
Alternative Dipping Sauce:
1/4 cup fish sauce
1/4 cup lime juice
2 tbsp sugar
2 tbsp water
1 garlic clove, minced
1 small chili, finely chopped
Instructions
Prepare the Ingredients:
Cook the vermicelli noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and rinse under cold water to stop cooking.
Arrange your fillings (shrimp, vegetables, herbs, and noodles) on a platter for easy assembly.
Make the Peanut Sauce:
In a small saucepan, combine hoisin sauce, peanut butter, water, soy sauce, and garlic. Stir over low heat until smooth and warm.
Transfer to a bowl and sprinkle with crushed peanuts.
Make the Alternative Sauce:
Mix fish sauce, lime juice, sugar, water, garlic, and chili in a bowl until the sugar dissolves.
Assemble the Rolls:
Fill a large, shallow dish with warm water. Dip a rice paper wrapper in the water for 5-10 seconds until softened but not too sticky.
Lay the wrapper flat on a clean surface.
Arrange a few shrimp halves (pink side down for a prettier presentation), followed by a small handful of vermicelli, vegetables, and herbs on the lower third of the wrapper.
Fold the sides of the wrapper inward, then tightly roll from the bottom up, enclosing the filling.
Repeat with the remaining wrappers and fillings.
